# Shounen Gaming Mangas (Mobile Version)

Shounen Gaming's Mobile App to Read Mangas.

## How It Works?

It connects to our Main Server and let's you login if you belong to our community. It has several mangas and keeps track of your progress in both Portuguese and English

## Who Can Use It?

Anyone who is in our Shounen Gaming's Discord Server is able to login and use our applications.

## Motivation

My main motivation developing this was not only to have a tool for me and my "Weeb" friends but to learn Riverpod and develop my Flutter skills at the same time.
